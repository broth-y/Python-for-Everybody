#3.1 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. 
# Pay the hourly rate for the hours up to 40 and 1.5 times the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. 
# Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). 
# You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. 
# not worry about error checking the user input - assume the user types numbers properly.

hrs = input("Enter Hours: ")
rate = input("Enter Rate per hour: ")

    opay = 40 * r + (h - 40) * r * 1.5    #pay = regular pay for 40 hours + overtime pay for hours above 40 at 1.5 times the rate

# Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:
# Score Grade
# >= 0.9 A
# >= 0.8 B
# >= 0.7 C
# >= 0.6 D
# < 0.6 F
# # If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit. For the test, enter a score of 0.85.
